I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Political Economy at University College London. I teach in UCL’s [Department of Political Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/) (School of Public Policy), as well as in the [Department of European Social and Political Studies](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/european-international-social-political-studies/).

Before joining UCL, I received my PhD in political science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/) in New York. Originally from Paderborn, Germany, I studied [politics and public administration](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/) at the University of Konstanz, and the University of Pavia in Italy, and worked for the OECD in Paris. 

My research is in comparative political economy, political behaviour, and education politics.
